Brain-Cluster-AI: Improvement Recommendations

Architecture & Design Improvements
1. Enhanced Confidence Scoring [x]
Instead of simple pattern matching for [CONFIDENCE: 0.XX], implement a more robust confidence extraction system using:
- Semantic analysis of the response (Implemented)
- Multiple confidence indicators (hedging words, certainty phrases) (Implemented)
- Self-consistency checking (ask the same question multiple ways)
- Calibrated confidence models trained on historical accuracy

2. Advanced Consensus Mechanisms [x]
Beyond DBSCAN clustering (implemented), consider:
- Attention-based voting: Weight neurons based on their historical performance on similar tasks (Implemented)
- Adversarial consensus: Include "devil's advocate" neurons that challenge dominant views
- Hierarchical consensus: Multi-level decision making (fast/slow thinking) (Implemented)
- Dynamic thresholds: Adjust consensus requirements based on decision importance (Implemented via auto-selection)

3. Memory Palace Enhancements [x]
The current chain-based approach (implemented) could benefit from:
- Graph-based memory: Replace linear chains with knowledge graphs for richer associations (Implemented)
- Episodic memory: Separate short-term working memory from long-term episodic storage (Implemented)
- Memory consolidation metrics: Track which memories are accessed frequently and strengthen them (Implemented)
