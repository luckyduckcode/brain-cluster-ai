# 🚀 Digital Cortex AGI v1.0.0 - Standalone Desktop Release

## ✨ First Public Release of the Digital Cortex AGI System

Welcome to the first public release of the Digital Cortex - a complete multimodal AGI system inspired by biological brain architecture!

## 🧠 What is the Digital Cortex?

The Digital Cortex is a bio-mimetic AGI architecture that implements a brain-inspired multi-agent AI system. Unlike traditional monolithic AI models, it uses specialized "neurons" (local LLMs) and "brain regions" (neural networks) working together in a container-based architecture.

### Key Innovations:
- **Container Architecture**: Multi-container pod with sensory/motor/brain/autonomic containers
- **Multimodal Learning**: Vision, audio, and text processing from YouTube videos
- **Memory Palace**: Graph-based knowledge storage and retrieval
- **Consensus System**: Multi-neuron decision making with personality diversity
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live thought visualization and system diagnostics

## 💻 Standalone Desktop Application

This release introduces a modern, native desktop application that makes the Digital Cortex accessible without complex setup:

### Features:
- **Real-time Chat**: Direct interface with Chappy's multimodal brain
- **Video Learning**: One-click YouTube video processing with progress tracking
- **Memory Visualization**: Explore and manage learned knowledge
- **System Monitoring**: Live brain status and performance metrics
- **Modern UI**: CustomTkinter interface with automatic dark/light themes
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power-user shortcuts for efficient interaction

## 📦 Installation
